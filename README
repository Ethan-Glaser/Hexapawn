Hewapawn is a personal project that I worked on Febuary 2019.
Hexapawn is a game like chess that is on a 3 X 3 board that
only includes 3 pawns for each team. The game is won by either 
getting to the opposite side of the board or by blocking the 
other opponent. I programed an AI to play this game that gets
smarter evry time you play. At first winning is easy but evetually 
it is almost impossible to beat the AI
